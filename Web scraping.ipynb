      "\\Description: ['Shree Vishwakarma Agam Chhen, located at Tuchimala tole of Bhaktapur is one of Bhaktapur’s most distinctive architectural structures. After building the Nyatapola temple, the Awal people are reported to have built the Agam Chhen.\\nThe most unusual aspect of its building is that, unlike any other wooden window, it has a window constructed of clay. That window is also known as Tellikata jhyal, which translates to “clay window.”\\nThe architecture is said to be 318 years old, which corresponds to the age of the Nyatapola temple.\\nFurthermore, the architecture was recently rebuilt and launched. This is the second time it has been renovated. It is reported that it was initially renovated after the 1990 earthquake.\\nHowever, there appear to be planning to showcase it as one of Bhaktapur’s museums.', 'Aadipadma Mahavihar is one of Bhaktapur’s oldest Vihars. Despite the lack of documentation detailing its origins, it is commonly referred to as Bhaktapur’s Jetho Vihar, which means “older one.” The vihar was referred to as Tombaha or Tungbaha in Rajbamsawali.\\nThis Mahavihar is the place where both the Panchara (Pancha dan) and Samyak Mahadan begin. During Mohani, a kumari is also set up in front of this Vihar. All of this just demonstrates the location’s antiquity and historical significance.\\nMoreover, during Panchadan, all five Dipankar buddhas are welcomed at Aadipadma Mahaihar after gathering at Suryamandhi’s dabali (platform). Only after which, does the panchadan procedure begin.\\nThe Vihar is located in Suryamadhi’s Taulachhen tole. Suryamadhi’s south-western corner has a short alley that leads directly to the vihar.', 'Bhaktapur’s Lokeshwor temple, also known as Karunamaya, is a gorgeous temple located within the municipal limits of Bhaktapur. The temple is surrounded by local homes, moreover, the temple’s backside is rather attached to a house too.\\nLegend has it that when Lichhavi King Narendra Deva was ready to introduce Rato Machhindranatha (Lord Karunamaya) to Nepal, it was determined to establish one of the three designated locations. The contemporary Lokeshwor temple, Silu Mahadeva (Phasidegal), and Aankha Bahal were those three locations.\\nThese locations are claimed to have been picked by a bird who was thought to be Lord Karunamaya’s emissary. The entire procedure was carried out under the auspices of tantrism.\\nAs a result, these sites were regarded as the holiest. When the task of establishing Karunamaya was not completed, Baladeva, King Narendra Deva’s son, established a Padmapani Lokeshwor there.\\nPadmapani Lokeshwor is a Hindu god who appears to always be holding a lotus in his palm. He is also known as the Lashkar dyo (Laska dyo) and Bhaktapur’s Karunamaya.\\nThe Jet Varna vihar is another name for it. It has Gaju Chaityas, Khamba Chaityas, Bajra Khatu Chaityas, Dharma Khatu, Vimba, Lokeshwor, and Dharma Dhatu Mandir on its premises.\\nReference legend: Ganesh Ranjeet', 'Indra Varna Mahavihar locally called Inabaha and Indra Varta Mahavihar is one of the important Mahavihar of Bhaktapur. It is assumed that in N.S.741 when King Jagarjyoti Malla was ruling over Nepalmandal, Devsingha Buddhacharya bought land from Hari in Badimangal Yugtole and made the Vihar.\\nIn the names of the erectors, Dev Singh, Jaya Singha and Melu Singha’s names come first. And the very same Devsingha also established a statue of Dipankar Buddha in N.S.749 in the name of his son Devadas.\\nThere is also the image of Pragyaparamita and Avalokiteshwora on the right and the left side of the main deity, Achhobhya Buddha.\\nThe vihar is also famous for a certain event named Barhe Chukegu. It is a part of the traditional Buddhist Chudakarma ritual where the boys of Bajracharyas and Shakyas go through Acharya Abhisheka. The event is more likely considered as a Tantric in grace rite that qualifies any Bajarcharya to become a priest.\\nDuring Gunla, daily bhajans (singing hymns ) are regulated there.\\nHowever, the torans of the vihar is in bizarre conditions. There are no images of the replicated deity in it. Besides, the architecture of the vihar also seems devastated by the 2015 earthquake. Even though there are people living there.\\nIndra Varna Mahavihar (Inabaha)\\nNevertheless, the temple-like architecture at the top of the building with two Pattas (Patah) hanging around it gives quite a traditional taste. Also, the wall paintings are abnormally beautiful.', 'Mangal Dharmadweep Mahavihar, which is located in Bhaktapur’s Golmadhi tole, is also known as Jhaur Bahi. In this Vihar, one of the five Dipankar Buddhas can be found.\\nMangal Dharmadweep Mahavihar (Jhaur Bahi)\\nThe Pauva arts are displayed here at Gunhi Punhi. This Vihar was constructed in the 13th century. Later, Jibtaj Bajraacharya’s descendants from Tadhichhen Baha renovated it (Tadhuchhen Bahal).\\nThis Bahi, like the others, has a rectangular courtyard with modest chaityas. It also features the artwork of many Buddhas on its walls. Normally, the passage is less congested. During Samyak Mahadan, Pnchadan, and Gunla Parva, however, the site is packed with worshipers.', 'Located inside a barely walked alley between Kwathandou and Bekhal, Dipankar Mahavihar is the home of one of the Dipankar Buddhas of Bhaktapur. He is supposed as the main Dipankar Buddha, thus after him, the vihar is named.\\nThe statue of Dipakhar Buddha at Dipankar Mahavihar\\nAs per the available scriptures, it was built in N.S. 750. And, fortunately, it is still in good condition, able to perform daily worshipping rituals and participate in Panchadan and Samyak Dan like holy events.\\nBeside Dipankar Buddha, there stands a statue of Mahankal, Manjushree, Ganesh and Shiva-Parvati, in this Mahavihar tagging the Red Tara. Some folk legends mention that Tara used to speak and was kept inside the bar while she was trying to leave the place.\\nThat is why many Tibetans and people from the Himalayan regions often pay a visit to this place.\\nThe temple of Red Tara at the premises of Dipankar Mahavihar\\nThe Mahavihar, however, is also come to know as the home of Kumari of Bhaktapur. Each year, during Dashain, the living goddess Kumari resides here for 15 days.\\nAlthough, there is not much movement in the area, when you cross upon that road, a fragrance of incense steal away your attention. There is peace in the air.\\nWhile analyzing the spiritual values of that Mahavihar, one cannot just ignore the architectural form. The combination of the temple and local residents seems quite distinct yet attractive. The struts are as beautiful as the other wooden pieces of Bhaktapur. They are well carved and presented.\\nDipankar Mahavihar\\nLikewise, there are Dharmadhatu Chaitya, Bajradhatu Chaitya, Khamba Chaitya, Gaju Chaitya, a hymning place (Sattal) with some fascinating paintings and a stone conduit on its premises. It’s a place worth visiting although the presence of local residents make you feel quite awkward, at first.\\nChaityas and Sattal at Dipankar Mahavihar', 'Jayakriti Mahavihar, also known as Thatu Bahi is one of the most prominent vihars of Bhaktapur. Each year, Samyak Panchadan like-substantial event takes place over there.\\nIt is located at Itachhen, on the western arena of the Na: Pukhu (Guhyepokhari of Bhaktapur). A two-storeyed building made out of a traditional Nepalese style (currently functioning as a Shree Gyan Bijaya Primary School) is also the house of one of the Dipankar Buddhas of Bhaktapur.\\nThere is a beautiful courtyard inside the building where one can find small chaityas and stupa along with exquisite wood’s working and the image of Padmapani Lokeshwora, the central deity of the Bahi.\\nThe vihar is placed in the highland, that’s why it is called thatu Bahi.\\nThe vihar, as mentioned in the inscriptions and scriptures ascertains that it is way older than other vihars. The presence of two Chaityas and a gate with Panchabuddha summarises that it was made in the Lichhavi era.\\nThere is even some chatter saying Na: Pukhu was later made on the land of Thathu Bahi.\\nIt is said that the vihar was also renovated by King Jitamitra Malla and Ugra Malla after Jaya Ratna Bajracharya, who was a member of Chatur Varna Mahavihar.\\nThe mentioned date when Jaya Ratna Bajracharya renovated it was N.S.794 and only after that, the Thatu Bahi was started to call Jayakriti Mahavihar. Moreover, it still seems to be in a good condition.', 'The uniqueness of this city never disappoints you especially when it comes to the name of places and temples. The Chuma Ganesha temple, designated as the very first Ganesh temple of Bhaktapur somehow, too falls in such fanciful legends and in weird naming.\\nBeing located in Chochhen tole of Bhaktapur made it geographically the temple situated in the upper part of the Bhaktapur Nagara. It is said that Chochhen originally came up after the term Choye Chongu Chhen which means the house of the upper part.\\nChuma Ganesh temple, on the other hand also has its own legendary story. Even the origin of its name has a story. It is said that the rats of that area beyond their nature scared the cats. And when someone tries to investigate the matter, they found out the image of Lord Ganesh.\\nChuma Ganesha\\nLegends say that the name Chuma is derived from the term Chu and Ma which respectively means the rat and line. Thus, assuming Lord Ganesha worshipped by the large line of mice, the name of the temple began to be called Chuma Ganesha.\\nHowever, there is one more story that is slightly different from the aforementioned yet the core story of being rats powerful is the same. As per the story, when the king saw a fight between cat and rat and saw cat losing into the rat. He got amazed and follow the rat. There he found the Chuma Ganesh.\\nAfter being blessed by him, he was also told that there is Bhadrakali in the south of the area. And he should go there and worship her. The king as ordered went there and worship her. Being pleased by the king, she then gave him instruction to build a nagara in between these two areas; Chuma Ganesha and Bhadrakali temple.\\nNext, the king establishes the Bhaktapur Nagar along with the first Ganesh temple, Astamatrikas and Astabhairavas.\\nBesides, the architecture of the temple is likewise quite unique. Although it is a pagoda-style temple, its false tire has multiple layers like design which indeed is unique and satisfactory for the eyes.\\nChuma Ganesha Temple', 'Salan Ganesh Dyo Chhen is the god house of Salan Ganesh Temple. However, it is more famous as Agam dyo chhen than the dyo chhen.\\nThe dyo chhen of Salan Ganesh is an exceptional architectural illustration. Unlike other dyo chhen (god’s house), which looks more like a residence but this dyo chhen owns some features matching the temple. Equivalently, it’s rare to find double torans even in temples too. Besides a pinnacle (Gajur) and beautiful carvings over struts, windows and doors made it more of a diversion to the orbs.\\nAgam dyo chhen\\nPC: Praz Santt/bhaktapur.com\\nThe flanking stone lions’ home although is declared a world heritage site, yet we are not allowed to observe the interior. Because it still remains occupied by the local resident thus it’s not open to the public.\\nAbout the age of the dyo chhen, there is no exact record regarding its erection yet there are some guesses which tells us that it might have been built when the Salan Ganesh temple was built. It somehow makes sense too.

The entire credit goes to King Srinivas Malla, the then-King of Lalitpur who erected it as a sign of friendship.\\nAside from that, there is an intriguing story concerning the Chyasalin mandap’s construction, which explains why it was built between the Pashupatinath temple and the 55-window palace. There is a Hindu concept that one should not live in front of the glorious deity.\\nAnd living directly in front of the Pashupatinath shrine was bad for both the king and the kingdom. Thus, Chyasalin Mandap is reported to be built in between them to avoid the temple’s powerful aurora from directly striking the palace.\\nThis venue once was also a popular choice for the poetry contest.

It is now on display at the National Art Museum. And, those magnificent lions were established in front of the temple before the catastrophic earthquake of 1934 AD occurred in Nepal.

From the bottom to the end of the plinth, there is a stone image of Wrestlers, Elephants, Lions, Griffins, and two Goddesses named Sighini and Baghini respectively.\\nThey all are placed according to their strengths. The first two wrestlers named Jai and Pratap are said to be 10 times stronger than a normal man.
